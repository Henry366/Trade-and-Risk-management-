# Trade-and-Risk-management-
A simple Python code that helps u split your lot size for partials the code only allows u take to take 2 min 3 max of partials, the partials ratio is 30/70 for 2, 20/30/50 for 3,  and a risk calculator that calculates the next risk for u base on the risk  strategy I used is 




if you take a loss of 1% the next trade u will assume only 0.5% per trade until you have made at least 50% of the drawdown of the equity dip from the trade risking 1% of equity

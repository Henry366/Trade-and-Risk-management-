# Trade-and-Risk-management-
A simple Python code that helps u split your lot size for partials the code only allows u take to take 2 min 3 max of partials, the partials ratio is 30/70 for 2, 20/30/50 for 3,  and a risk calculator that calculates the next risk for u base on the risk  strategy I used is 





Default risk 1%
Drawdown Risk 0.5%
If -1% next risk should be Drawdown Risk
If -0.5% next risk stays Drawdown Risk
If + % of 50% of the previous risk next risk should be the default risk
